Answers in C for the Candian Computing Competition.

Of particular note is my answer for 2012/day1/s4.c, which runs 20x faster than
the unofficial solution linked to by University of Waterloo
(http://mmhs.ca/ccc/2012/s42012\_kl.txt). The difficulty for this question is
listed as 5 stars. Here is the difficulty scheme.
```
>\*	an average grade 11 student should get this
>\*\*	an average grade 12 student should get this
>\*\*\*	a good grade 12 student MIGHT get this
>\*\*\*\*	the best grade 12 student MIGHT get this if given enough time
>\*\*\*\*\*	the teacher will get this after many days, or maybe never :-)

Also of note is that I have begun working on the stage 2 problems for 2012,
which have no available answers online.
